# Background
Havning recently signed up for [Brick Borrow](https://www.brickborrow.com/) I want to ensure that I capture each build as a timelapse. As part of this I wanted to show current step in the instructions in the background on my Legion Go, however it has a quirk where the display is technically in landscape. As such to mirror it on any other screen so that I could also use the instructions, Windows would helpfully also rotate the mirrored screen. This application is my overengineered solution to that, allowing instructions to be controlled from one browser and others using websockets to stay updated as the main screen moves steps/manuals. I have also attempted to use gphoto2 to capture the timelapse and ffmpeg to convert the captured images into a video.
